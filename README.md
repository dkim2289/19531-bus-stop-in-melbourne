**19531-bus-stop-in-melbourne**

## What it does
**19531-bus-stop-in-melbourne** is a simple application that directly gets the real-time location information of two buses, 200 and 207, which stops by the bus stop 19531 in Melbourne CBD, from [Transport Victoria](https://transport.vic.gov.au)'s [OpenData](https://opendata.transport.vic.gov.au/dataset/gtfs-realtime/resource/19e18563-677f-4a21-b3a0-404e0cfa20e2), and returns how many minutes the buses are away from the stop. 

## Background
I often need this information because I live around the corner, but PTV's is not reliable. Besides, it's fun! :D
